To help get you started, I've written a few example scenarios for configuring a Docker container for Stump. These are configurations that I felt were useful, but if you please consider [sharing your own](https://github.com/aaronleopold/stump/issues/new/choose) if you have a useful one.

For all of the examples below, I'll be mimicking a setup very close to my own usage but just trimmed down for the sake of brevity.
