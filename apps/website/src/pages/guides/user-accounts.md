# Users and User Accounts

Stump has two user account types:

- **Server Owner**: The owner of the server. This user has full control over the server, and can add and remove users.
- **Server Member**: A user that is granted access to the server. This user has majority read-only access to the server.

An 'unclaimed' Stump server will prompt for a server owner to create their account, and will automatically assign them the **Server Owner** role.

More instructions coming soon!
