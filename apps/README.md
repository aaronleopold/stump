# apps

The 'apps' directory is where Stump applications are located. These are separate from the Rust core, and are individual applications.

`client`: A React application that is served by a Stump server. This is the primary web-client for interacting with a Stump server.

`website`: A Next.js application for the Stump landing site and documentation pages. The documentation is created using [Markdoc](https://markdoc.io/). This code gets deployed to [stumpapp.dev](http://stumpapp.dev)
