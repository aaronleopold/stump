// This entire `job` crate was *heavily* inspired by the `job` crate from spacedrive.
// https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/tree/main/core/src/job
// This taught me a lot and honestly it would have taken me forever without the reference.
// HOWEVER, it is still really not an optimal solution. It's a little messy,
// and a little all over the place, and it isn't structured in a way that makes it easy
// for the UI to consume. But, for now it works.
