# Series

The most important takeaway from this section is that **series are just folders** inside of a library.

![A series is just a folder](/images/1folder1series.gif)

Consider the following example library:

```
. /Users/aaronleopold/Documents/Stump/Demo
├── Daredevil
│   ├── Daredevil 001.cbz
│   ├── Daredevil 002.cbz
│   └── ...
└── The Amazing Spider-Man (2018)
    ├── The Amazing Spider-Man 001 (2018).cbz
    ├── The Amazing Spider-Man 002 (2018).cbz
    └── ...
```

This library has **2 series**: _Daredevil_ and _The Amazing Spider-Man (2018)_.

Coming Soon!
