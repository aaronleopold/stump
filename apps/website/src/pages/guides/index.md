# An Introduction to Stump

## What is Stump?

Stump is an open source, self hostable, media server for your comic books, manga, and other digital books. It is designed to be _easy to use_ and _easy to deploy_.

The short on how it works:

- Install and run Stump on a computer or NAS (Network Attached Storage).
- Configure your libraries (i.e. _where your media lives_), and Stump will take care of the rest.
- To read your media, you can use the web interface or any compatible client.

## What isn't Stump?

Stump **is not** a tool used for fetching or downloading any kind of media. It is a tool used to host and access **your own media**. You may think of it like a Plex server for your comic books/manga/etc. If you are unfamiliar with Plex, you can think of Stump as a personal Netflix, for comic books/manga/etc, that lives on a computer in your home (like a NAS).

## What's compatibility like?

Stump works on all major browsers and operating systems.

The hardware requirements vary and should serve **only as a guide**. Generally speaking, 1GB of RAM and disk space is more than enough. Stump also runs well on low-powered ARM-based single board computers, such as a Raspberry Pi (I personally host a Stump server on a Pi 4).
