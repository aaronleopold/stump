## An introduction to Stump

Stump is an open source, self hostable, media server for your comic books, manga, and other digital media. It is designed to be easy to use, and to be easy to deploy.

The short on how it works:

- Install and run Stump on a computer or NAS (Network Attached Storage).
- Configure your libraries (_where your media lives_), and Stump will take care of the rest.
- To read your media, you can use the web interface or any compatible client.
