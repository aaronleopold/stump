# FAQ

## Why Stump?

There are some really solid, self-hostable, OPDS media servers out there. The most notable probably being [Komga](https://komga.org). Komga is a phenomenal open source project, and frankly a great alternative. Stump is heavily influenced by Komga, striving to maintain all of the coveted features while also bringing about improvements in usability and performance.

Overall, Stump has a few key features:

- Tiny footprint (~41MB Docker image, ~TBD MB executable)
- Super performant, even on less powerful hardware (e.g. Raspberry Pi)
  - < 5s total time for an initial scan of a library with ~200 comics, tested on a Raspberry Pi 4
- Emphasis on UI and UX (e.g. it's pretty and easy to use)
