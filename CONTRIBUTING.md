# Contributing

You can contribute by opening new issues or PRs. Please do not drop random PRs without talking with me first, please follow these steps:

1. Check to see if an issue already exists relevant to your feature/topic
2. Create an issue (if an issue does not already exist) and express interest in working it
3. Create a fork of the repository.
4. Create a new feature branch from `develop`.
5. Add appropiate documentation to public items.
6. Ensure you have your code formatter properly configured.
7. Once you add your contributions, create a PR from your feature branch into `develop` - _not_ `main`.
8. Be sure to pull in new changes **before** making the PR.

Thanks for contributing to my project!!
